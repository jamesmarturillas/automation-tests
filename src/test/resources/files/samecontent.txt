The morning started as usual for John, toast and tea while waiting for Mrs. Hudson to bring up the morning paper. In about 1 and half minutes into brewing the tea, in comes Sherlock looking strangely ecstatic from his daily morning walk. We have a case, Sherlock screams excitedly. The unsuspecting John spilled his tea.
